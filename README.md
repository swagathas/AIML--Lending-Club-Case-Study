# AIML--Lending-Club-Case-Study

Project Objective:

To identify the risky loan applicants at the time of loan application so that such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

In other words, to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. And thus minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

In a nutshell, we made use of EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
